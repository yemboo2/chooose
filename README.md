# Choose Coding Challenge

Run the project with `npm start` - this runs the backend and frontend.

If you want to start/run them separately then use

`npm run start-be` for the backend

or

`npm run start-fe` for the frontend.

Hint: When running the FE make sure to disable CORS in browser, otherwise it's not working atm.!
